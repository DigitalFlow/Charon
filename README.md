# Charon - Developer Ticketing System

You're being called and messaged all the time and the pile of tasks is ever increasing?
Your projects are using project management systems, but you need to plan your work for each day personally in a global way?

Then Charon is there for you.
This is a tool to help developers manage their work.
In addition to that, Charon features a webservice which enables others to create tasks inside your backlog, which you can then plan inside your boards.
If configured, Charon also allows others to see what you're working on and to gather status feedback, so that you are less interrupted.

There is a swim lane task board where you can track your current work by status.
Planning tasks by day and other smart features such as tracking the time you worked on tasks is in work as well.
